# Using an MQ Light API client
{: #mql_using}

The {{site.data.keyword.mql}} API provides a simple AMQP-based messaging interface for Java&trade;, Node.js, Python, and Ruby. It is provided for backward compatibility with the earlier {{site.data.keyword.mql}} service.
{:shortdesc}

In most cases, Message Hub is best used with a Kafka client. The {{site.data.keyword.mql}} API is easier to learn but it
has very limited scalability and does not offer interoperability with other Message Hub APIs.

The {{site.data.keyword.mql}} API is available in the following {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} regions only: US South, United Kingdom, and Sydney. The {{site.data.keyword.mql}} API not available in the Germany region or in Bluemix Dedicated.

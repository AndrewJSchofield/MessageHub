# Linking to other services using bridges
{: #bridges}

Bridges are unidirectional links between {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} and another service. Bridges allow either
data to be read from {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} and written
into another service, or data to be read from another service and written into {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}. 
{:shortdesc}

The key benefits of using {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} bridges are the following:  

* You can define bridges administratively, so you do not need to write application code.
* The lifecycle of each bridge is monitored and managed by the {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} service. For example, if a bridge encounters an error, it is automatically restarted by {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}.
* Bridges are integrated with the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} platform. For example, the logging and monitoring information generated by  bridges is directed to the Kibana and Grafana dashboards.

You might find bridges useful in the following two common scenarios:

* Consuming data from one or more data sources into {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}.
* Transferring data from {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} into another service. For example, to long-term storage.

## {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} bridges
{: notoc}

* We provide the following two types of bridge: 
  - {{site.data.keyword.objectstorageshort}} bridge, which transfers {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} data to an instance of the [Object Storage service ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](/docs/services/ObjectStorage/index.html){:new_window}.
  - MQ bridge, which takes message data from {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} MQ and transfers it to a topic in {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}. We intend to support a wider range of bridges in the future.
* Currently, bridges are available in all {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} public environments. Bridges are not available in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} Dedicated.
* You can administer bridges in the following two ways:
  - Using a [REST API ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/message-hub-docs){:new_window}, which is an extension to the existing {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} Administration API. You can also findexamples of how to use curl to manage the lifecycle of bridges at [message-hub-docs ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/message-hub-docs){:new_window}. We might change this REST API as we continue to develop bridges. We intend to stabilize this API.
  - Using the {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} dashboard in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console.
* You can associate a maximum of two bridges of any type with an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} service. We will continue to review this limitation as we continue to develop bridges.
* There is no additional charge for using bridges beyond their messaging operations.
* The {{site.data.keyword.objectstorageshort}} bridge concatenates messages using newline characters as separators as it writes the data into {{site.data.keyword.objectstorageshort}}. This makes it unsuitable for messages that contain embedded newline characters and for binary message data.
* Object naming conventions that are currently used by the {{site.data.keyword.objectstorageshort}} bridge might change in future.
* The MQ bridge does not support the use of SSL/TLS to protect the privacy and integrity of dataas it is transferred between the bridge and the MQ queue manager. We intend to add support for using SSL/TLS to the bridge. 

However, you can use the [{{site.data.keyword.SecureGatewayfull}} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](/docs/services/SecureGateway/secure_gateway.html){:new_window} service to send your data
through a secure tunnel between {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}
and a {{site.data.keyword.SecureGateway}} client that you can
install on-premises. In this configuration, the communication on either end of the tunnel is not
secured using SSL/TLS.
